ThirtySix Questions

In Mandy Len Catron’s Modern Love essay, “To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This,” she refers to a study by the psychologist Arthur Aron (and others) that explores whether intimacy between two strangers can be accelerated by having them ask each other a specific series of personal questions. 

The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one. 😅

The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. 😄

To quote the study’s authors, “One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.” 

Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue. 🤔
